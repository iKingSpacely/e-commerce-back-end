# E-Commerce Backend Test

## Description
Welcome to my e-commerce backend test! Using the existing starter code provided by the instructor staff, I was able to complete the backend for the e-commerce site using express API, sequelize, and MySQL database and ensure that it works through Insomnia. You can find these GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE tests in the walkthrough vide for all 3 sections (categories, products, and tags).

## Installation
Clone down the repo and run npm I to install the dependences provide in the package.json. Please make sure you create your own .env file, though, to run MySQL. In MySQL, run the following code: mysql â€“u (your username) -p, then provide your password when prompted. Following this, please run npm run seed and then nodemon (or node) server.js to make sure that the app is listening within insomnia to test the routes.
